# How to Contribute

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

- [Code of Conduct][code of conduct]

## Testing

We are using the [Jest][jest] framework for testing. BikeTag API mocking is configured via [msw][msw]. This makes it simple to mock API responses. Simply add a new handler for an endpoint to `mocks/handlers.js` and that's it. These mocks are automatically configured to work for all new and existing tests.

Here's an example that mocks a response when making a `POST` request to `https://api.biketag.org/1/portland/getBikeTag/1`:

```js
const handlers = [
  rest.post(
    'https://api.biketag.org/1/portland/getBikeTag/1',
    (_req, res, ctx) => {
      const response = {
        data: {
          tagnumber: 1,
        },
        success: true,
        status: 200,
      };
      return res(ctx.json(response));
    }
  ),
];
```

## Submitting Changes

We use [commitizen][commitizen] to enforce [conventional commits][conventional commits]. This enables us to automate both semantic versioning and npm releases.

Install the `commitizen` command line tool:

```bash
npm install -g commitizen
```

Now simply use `git cz` or just `cz` instead of `git commit` when committing.

If you prefer not to install the `commitizen` command globally, alternatively you can use `npm run commit` instead of `git commit`.

## Coding Conventions

- Prettier is ran and applied automatically as part of a precommit hook, so you don't have to worry about semicolons or trailing commas

## Inspirations

This package follows the lead of the Open-Source API [node-imgur][node-imgur], with it's configurations for compiling, testing, and contributing to Javascript APIs written in TypeScript. Also, the BikeTag API utilizes the `node-imgur` package to do it's thing, with admiration.
