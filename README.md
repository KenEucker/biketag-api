The new BikeTag javascript client, written entirely in typescript.

This project is heavily influenced by the [node-imgur][node-imgur] package, the Imgur API and it's documentation, and Sanity.IO's javascript client.

Using the typescript library configured and developed on the node-imgur v2 project: https://github.com/kaimallea/node-imgur, this package comes bundled with testing using jest and automated releases using github actions. Many thanks to Kaimallea for collaborating with me on the imgur API because I learned so much along the way!
