# 1. Purpose

BikeTag’s Mission is to support the game of BikeTag all over the world. Our volunteer team is distributed and we donate our time towards our mission from all over the world for those games of BikeTag that are supported worldwide. As such, we are committed to adhering to a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for the images and location information submitted to the biketag.org website as well as representatives and volunteers at official BikeTag events.

We invite all those who participate in our game of BikeTag, within each of the regional BikeTag communities, and on platforms that facilitate communication within the community; to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

BikeTag participants are required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. This code will be shared with visitors to the website and BikeTag volunteers will enforce this code throughout the communities where BikeTag is.

tl;dr:

Have fun, be kind to one another, keep yourself safe.

- Inclusive

# 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected to be used as a resource for players to know what is expected of those who are involved in BikeTag, in all venues where BikeTag is present:

Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.

Be inclusive, friendly, inviting, and helpful to those around you. There may be participants who are rarely on a bicycle and it’s important to foster those people who may not be as seasoned a rider as you.

Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions, as well as in the information submitted for each BikeTag.

Attempt collaboration before conflict.

Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

Be mindful of your surroundings when playing a round of BikeTag.

Refrain from insulting, harassing, demeaning, or otherwise with respect to other events and other players in the community. Report behavior if you see it and do not attack others.

# 5. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community, as such, the BikeTag Ambassadors who observe these behaviors on their rides are expected to address and report such behaviors:

Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.

Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.

Posting or displaying violent material or encouraging violence, either on the BikeTag app or other BikeTag websites, including social media pages for BikeTag.

Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information online or to other players: (“doxing”).

Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.

Inappropriate photography or recording.

Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).

Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

# 6. Playing a round of BikeTag on BikeTag.Org

When creating a new round on BikeTag.Org, or any of the other ways in which players can submit new rounds for BikeTag.Org games, all information submitted and images uploaded are public. The images are free and available for anyone to use and the information provided will be credited with the submitted images. By participating in BikeTag games run by this organization, you agree to have the data be publicly available. The BikeTag game only asks for the information needed to continue playing on to the next round and will never ask you to provide sensitive information.

As players find themselves biking to new places in their city, it is encouraged to be mindful of your adventure to and from playing a round of BikeTag. It is not required that players submit a round in any specific location, you can always bike away from a location and submit later. If you are in danger in any way, please get to safety and ask for help if you cannot.

Those who post a round of BikeTag agree that this Code Of Conduct is fair and something they agree to uphold for the duration of their ride. We appreciate the community’s help in keeping our mission to promote inclusive bike fun a successful one.

# 7. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, players, viewers) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all official BikeTag venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to the BikeTag community.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

# 8. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including players and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. The BikeTag team reserves the right to remove any BikeTag post from the website any time. Players which do not follow this Code of Conduct may be removed from the game. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion of the ability to submit new rounds of BikeTag or comment on BikeTag posts. Community members are encouraged to address issues within themselves and to resolve these matters with the community at large. Individuals who fail to uphold the reasonable expectations of this code of conduct will be contacted privately regarding reports made or situations observed. These contacted individuals may respond to the reports privately, but there is no guarantee of an audience from the BikeTag team regarding the matter moving forward.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
